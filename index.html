  Hillary Rodham Clinton once said, "there cannot be true democracy unless women's voices are heard." I believe that this is an important statement to cherish, especially as a woman, going into a field of underrepresented females in computer science. I want to fill a position in a high IT company, Google. I dream to major in computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and get a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in computer science. I plan to pursue my knowledge in computer science and technology. This is my dream career where I strive to acieve my passion in computer science, follow the footsteps of my father, and represent women in a male-dominant field.

              Being on a swim team and balancing my straight As has shown me that I am willing to put in hard work to achieve my goals no matter what. I do not do things unless I really want to. Every decision I make is to benefit my academics and success in life. Whether it was pushing through my six week summer geometry course (we received piles of more work than other classes), coming home late and tired from swimming, or running a club; I have ensured that all the things I do get the best version of my efforts. I believe that being on the swim team has led me to possess collaboration and teamwork skills necessary to be on an IT job. Debate and running other clubs provided me with leadership and communication skills. These experiences have allowed me to achieve what I want, when I want it.

<h3>I am an ambitious person who hopes to bring better representation for females in a field I am quite passionate about. Computer science and technology needs to close the gender gap, and I hope to pursue it. Thank you so much for you time, and enjoy discovering the rest of the website!</h3>
